	<h1>Hi! Welcome to my site.</h1>

	<p>
	For right now, this is my small corner of the internet.  I intend to finally do a little writing.  I'm a network and systems engineer, open source advocate, technical writer and musician.  It's hard to say right now what's going to end up on this site, but it will most likely involve one of those things.

	Without resorting to a .gif of `Under Construction,' this site is a work in progress.  It's built using Jekyll, at which I'm completely new.  I thought this would be an enjoyable and simple way to get some writing done without the hassle of maintaining a WordPress (or other CMS) site.  This site may change sporadically (and drastically) as I figure out Jekyll and how to streamline its style.  Feel free to drop me an email if you have any constructive comments.
