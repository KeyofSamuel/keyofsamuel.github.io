I have this penchant (or obsession, maybe) for having good clean music scores when I'm playing almost anything.  I can memorize, but my memory isn't what it used to be.  And when you have a group of musicians, especially with varying degrees of experience and ability, a clean score that everyone can follow makes life so much easier.  In every group I've lead or served as a "music director," I've created scores for our arrangements.  Lilypond has been a dream to work with.  It has its peculiarities, but I've worked with the large commercial score packages out there, and I keep coming back to Lilypond.  It helps that it's native for Linux, but I truly prefer Lilypond to any scoring software out there.

The following links are to my GitHub repositories containing several different types of Lilypond templates.  These templates were created to provide an easy place to start creating music scores without needing a complete understanding of all the different options and customizations.  As long as you understand the basics of the tempate and Lilypond specific markdown, it should be easy to build quick and functional scores.
