Just about all parts of the technology field require some documentation.  Even some of the non-technology related jobs I've had found benefit from a little documentation.  One of the first projects I got into when I started in IT was creating network documentation.  I had been using Linux for a short time already and knew there had to be some good open source documentation software out there.  And, of course, I found LaTeX2e.  

The following links are to my GitHub repositories containing several different types of LaTeX templates.  These templates were created to provide an easy place to start creating documents without having to have a complete understanding of all the different preamble options and customizations.  As long as you understand the basics of the tempate and LaTeX specific markdown, it should be easy to build good looking and functional documents.
